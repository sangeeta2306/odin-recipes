      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked
        confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy
        or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always,
        have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts,
        frosting, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with
        brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a
        blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States
        at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the first
        half of the 20th century. Brownies are typically eaten by hand or with
        utensils, and may be accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with
        ice cream (Ã  la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with
        powdered sugar. In North America, they are common homemade treats and
        they are also popular in restaurants, ice cream parlors, and
        coffeehouses.

        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
          baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare cookie layer: Beat 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4
          cup white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl until
          creamy. Add one egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda in a bowl.
          Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is
          combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough evenly into
          the prepared baking dish; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare brownie layer: Stir 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1
          teaspoon vanilla in a bowl; add two eggs and beat well. Mix in cocoa
          powder until well-combined. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, and
          1/8 teaspoon salt until batter is combined. Pour over cookie layer and
          spread to cover completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
          comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into
          20 bars. Enjoy!
