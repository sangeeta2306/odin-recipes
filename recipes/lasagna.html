      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the
        oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian
        dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such
        as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables,
        cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan), and
        seasonings and spices.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese,
        which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled
        with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The
        resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular
        portions.

        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>

        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>

        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>

        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>3 large eggs</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
          heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add
          onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
          garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
          simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted
          water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
          occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
          Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
          degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon
          fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
          over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
          the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
          once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
          mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
          bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
          serving.
