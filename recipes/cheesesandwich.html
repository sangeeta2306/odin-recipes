      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        A cheese sandwich is a sandwich made with cheese on bread. Typically
        semi-hard cheeses are used for the filling, such as Cheddar, Red
        Leicester, or Double Gloucester. A Guardian article called the cheese
        sandwich a "British lunchtime staple".[1] Using a pie iron or frying pan
        can transform the cheese sandwich into a cheese toastie. When a meat
        sandwich is prepared, the cheese becomes the accompaniment, and the
        sandwich is known by other names such as ham sandwich, tuna sandwich,
        etc. If the cheese is melted on such a sandwich, the term melt sandwich
        is used.

          Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one
          side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot
          skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one
          side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.

          Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking
          until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread,
          butter, and slice of cheese.
